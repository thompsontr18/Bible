# Bible Books & Chapters

<h3>This is a simple Python program that supplies the user with a text from the Bible based on the book and chapter they provide. This project uses web scraping to find its data.<br><br>
As of now, this program only works for NKJV (New King James Version).<br><br>
When you are giving the book you want to read from, please make sure your book is spelled exactly as it comes from the Bible.
